# CS 250 – Module Eight Journal Reflection

## Portfolio Artifact
For this course, I submitted my Sprint Review and Retrospective from the final project. This artifact demonstrates my understanding of Agile and Scrum practices, including sprint planning, user stories, reviews, and retrospectives.

## Reflection

### Interpreting User Needs and User Stories
I interpret user needs by breaking requirements into clear, actionable goals that focus on what the user wants to accomplish. Creating user stories helps by framing requirements from the user’s perspective, which keeps development focused on delivering value and meeting expectations.

### Approach to Developing Programs and Agile Practices
I approach program development using an iterative and incremental process. Agile practices such as sprint planning, maintaining a prioritized backlog, sprint reviews, and retrospectives help me stay adaptable and continuously improve both the product and my workflow.

### Being a Good Team Member in Software Development
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, collaborating respectfully, and being accountable for assigned tasks. It also involves being open to feedback and supporting the team’s shared goals to deliver quality software.
